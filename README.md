# Pacman Behavioral Analyses

Comprises three main pieces of the pacman behavioral analyses. Uses R

## Pilot data behavior and validation

Basic analyses showing normative behavior in the pilot sample and validation that the timing and online task works as expected. See `normative behavrior` files and `analysis/task_validation_sanity_checks/`

## Survival Analysis

Analyses to predict time of turnaround on the online samples as well as the intracranial samples. See `analysis/aalen`

## Brain-behavioral analyses

Uses task behavior to predict neural respones. See `analysis/theta`
