## Clinical Cohort Analyses

In this folder I focus on the analyses for the clinical cohort that was recruited in late Fall 2023. 

### Recruitment

TODO - Have Annabelle write up a description of her work and what she did-- how may people, how much were they paid, what were the cut-off scores and what were the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Basically, a summary of the prolific page.

## Current To-Do

1. **Clean and Conduct EDA on new Clinical Cohort**
    * Need to basically rerun the normative behavior script but with the clinical sample to catch any missingness or any funky data files.
       - Need to determine if this is the exploration set or not. If we do not see any associations, we will not run another sample. Maybe let's collect half a clinical sample, and test that. If we see associations, we try to replicate them in the new dataset. Will need to look at the power calculations for that though...
2. **Determine specific hypotheses of increased avoidance**
    * Does the clinical cohort stay farther away from the ghost?
    * Does the clinical cohort eat less dots?
    * Does the clinical cohort tend to get the last big dot less often
    * Does adding anxiety as a baseline covariate in the survival models help the model predict turnaround?
    * Maybe I should talk with Sheri about it?
