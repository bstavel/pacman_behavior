## Theta and Approach-Avoidance Conflict

### Differences in Hippocampal Theta in Approach vs Avoidance in Ghost Trials 

See `aac_ghost_nghost.Rmd` for details. Analyses presented at SFN 2022. Uses linear mixed effects models to compare hippocampal theta during approach vs avoidance during ghost trials


### Comparison of Hippocampal Theta in ghost vs no-ghost trials

See `ghost_v_nghost.Rmd` for details. Analyses presented at SFN 2022. 


### Versions that don't use a theta timeseries as the dependent variable

See `trial_theta_sliced.Rmd` for versions of regresions at each time point instead. Slightly different, but `theta_lag_analysis.Rmd` looks at possible delays between task behavior at trial level theta.
